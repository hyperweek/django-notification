===================
django-notification
===================

Many sites need to notify users when certain events have occurred and to allow
configurable options as to how those notifications are to be received.

The project aims to provide a Django app for this sort of functionality.
This includes:

    * Submission of notification messages by other apps.
    * Notification messages on signing in.
    * Notification messages via email (configurable by user).
    * Notification messages via feed.

This fork includes following improvements:

    * HTML emails are sent if you include a full.html file in your folder

    * CSS is precompiled and rendered into the HTML elements (some email
      clients don't support external css)

    * Celery support for queuing

Installation
============

* Install django-notification with your favorite Python package manager::

    pip install -e git://github.com/hyperweek/django-notification.git#egg=django_notification-dev

* Add ``'notification'`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ...
        'notification',
    ]
